# Silna PA Demo
**Prior Authorization Automation — AI Deployment Analyst Project**

A working demonstration of end-to-end prior authorization workflow automation, built as a supplement to my application for the AI Deployment Analyst role at Silna Health.

## What This Does

This project simulates Silna's core orchestration loop:

1. **Document Intelligence** — A clinical ABA treatment plan PDF is parsed by Claude's API, extracting structured fields (patient name, DOB, ICD-10 code, CPT code, NPI, payer, units, medical necessity summary) with no OCR configuration required.
2. **Browser Agent** — A Playwright agent logs into a mock insurance payer portal, populates the prior authorization form with the extracted data, submits the request, and verifies the confirmation — fully autonomously.
3. **Results Dashboard** — Every agent action is timestamped and logged, displayed alongside extraction metadata and raw JSON output.

Total time from PDF → confirmed PA reference number: **~19 seconds**.

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, pip

```bash
# Clone and create virtual environment
git clone <repo-url>
cd silna-pa-demo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# Configure API key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Generate the sample treatment plan PDF
python sample_docs/generate_treatment_plan.py
```

## Running the Demo

**Terminal 1 — Start the portal:**
```bash
cd portal
python app.py
# Running on http://127.0.0.1:5050
```

**Terminal 2 — Run the agent:**
```bash
python agent/pa_agent.py
```

A Chromium browser will open and complete the full workflow autonomously. Results are saved to `outputs/agent_run.json`.

**View the dashboard:**
```

```

## Design Decisions

### Why Claude API over Tesseract OCR
Traditional OCR requires post-processing pipelines to interpret extracted text — you get raw characters, not structured meaning. Claude reads the document as a clinician would, returning a typed JSON object with field-level accuracy. For complex healthcare documents with varied layouts, this is significantly more robust.

### Automation vs. Orchestration
Silna's CEO draws a sharp distinction between *automation* (performing a single task) and *orchestration* (coordinating across channels to deliver a complete outcome). This project reflects that framing: the browser agent is one channel within a larger pipeline. In production, this would sit alongside phone agents, EDI integrations, and fax workflows — each handling the payer channels that require them. The `pa_agent.py` module is explicitly designed to be callable by an orchestration layer, not just as a standalone script.

### ABA as the Target Specialty
ABA therapy was chosen deliberately. It is Silna's strongest vertical, requires frequent re-authorizations (every 6 months), involves complex clinical documentation, and uses payer-specific medical necessity criteria — making it the highest-complexity domain to demonstrate competence in.

### Format Normalization at Extraction Time
The treatment plan PDF stores the patient's date of birth as `"March 14, 2018"` — a human-readable
format that cannot be directly entered into an HTML date input, which requires `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Rather than parsing and reformatting dates in a post-processing step, the extraction prompt
instructs Claude to return DOB in `YYYY-MM-DD` format directly:

> *"Date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format"*

This is a deliberate design choice: normalization happens at extraction time, so `map_to_portal_fields()`
produces values that are immediately portal-ready. The agent never touches date formatting logic.

The same principle applies to any field where the document format diverges from the portal format
(e.g., payer names, unit descriptions). The prompt is the single source of transformation logic —
not scattered across the pipeline.

### Status Check as a Follow-up Loop
After submission, a second agent flow re-authenticates, navigates to the status page,
and retrieves the current PA status by reference number. This mirrors Silna's core
follow-up cadence — they tune re-check frequency per payer and specialty rather than
polling on a fixed schedule.

In production this would run on a cron schedule (or event trigger) rather than
sequentially in the same process. The 5-second delay in the demo is a stand-in for
that interval, making the two-phase structure explicit without requiring a scheduler.

## Mapping to the Job Description

| JD Responsibility | How This Project Addresses It |
|---|---|
| Extract structured information from healthcare documents using OCR and agentic AI | `doc_intel/extractor.py` uses Claude to extract 8 typed fields from an ABA treatment plan PDF |
| End-to-end deployment of browser agents for web-based workflows | `agent/pa_agent.py` automates a complete PA submission workflow using Playwright |
| Translate healthcare workflows into clear technical specifications | The mock portal required modeling real PA workflow steps, form fields, and payer logic |
| Analyze model outputs for accuracy and identify areas for improvement | The dashboard tracks extraction accuracy, token usage, and step-level agent success |
| Create documentation and playbooks for reproducible prompt strategies | `EXTRACTION_PROMPT` in `extractor.py` is a documented, version-controlled prompt template |
| Measure and evaluate progress with clearly defined metrics | Dashboard surfaces: total time, steps logged, fields extracted, PA reference confirmation |
